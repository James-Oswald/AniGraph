# AniGraph
JS web application that displays graphical data, such as anime from each season, about a userâ€™s anime list from MyAnimeList.net. 

Server Side is probably abandoned since MAL released their offical API in July 2020 and I no longer need to web scrape. Client Side is still a useful tool for me.
